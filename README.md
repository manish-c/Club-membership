# Club-membership

This is a Club membership client-server application. Entire project is built on JavaFX which is a software platform to build desktop applications. It is written as Java API, so JavaFX application can reference APIs from any Java library. It uses FXML for creating user interface which is an XML-based declarative markup language.
It has two levels of access, User and Admin. Any individual can sign up for this with a ‘user’ access and only an existing admin can change a ‘user’ access to ‘admin’. A User can view all other users, change his/her information and can view the new users graph of his/her own ‘major’. An Admin can also update all other user’s information excluding the password. Graph generated for admin is collective new users irrespective of any field.
